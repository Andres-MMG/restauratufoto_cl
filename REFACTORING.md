# RestauraTuFoto.cl Refactoring Summary

## Overview

The codebase has been refactored from a flat structure to a more scalable, maintainable architecture following modern React best practices. This document summarizes the key changes made during the refactoring process.

## Major Changes

### 1. Feature-First Organization

- Code reorganized by business domains (features) rather than technical concerns
- Each feature now contains its own components, hooks, and services
- Created dedicated feature directories for:
  - `authentication` - User auth, login/registration
  - `payment` - Payment processing, pricing plans
  - `photo-restoration` - Core photo processing functionality

### 2. Atomic Design Implementation

- UI components refactored to follow Atomic Design principles:
  - Atoms: Button, Input
  - Molecules: Modal, ComparisonSlider, CallToAction
  - Organisms: BenefitsList, Testimonials
  - Layout: Header, Footer, MainLayout

### 3. Clean Architecture

- Clear separation of concerns:
  - UI layer (components)
  - Business logic (hooks)
  - Data access (services)
- Reduced coupling between components
- Each layer has specific responsibilities

### 4. State Management

- Migrated global state to feature-specific Zustand stores
- Created custom hooks to encapsulate state management logic:
  - `useAuthStore`
  - `usePhotoRestoration`
  - `useNotifications`

### 5. Component Refactoring

- Broke down large, monolithic components into smaller, focused ones
- Added JSDoc comments to all major components
- Implemented prop typing for better type safety
- Enhanced reusability of components across features

### 6. Utility Functions

- Centralized utility functions in `shared/utils`
- Added new utility functions for formatting and validation
- Improved error handling in utility functions

## File Migration Overview

### Pages
- `HomePage.tsx` - Refactored to use modular components
- `PricingPage.tsx` - Migrated to use new component structure
- `PaymentPage.tsx` - Refactored to use payment feature components
- `AppPage.tsx` - New component that uses PhotoRestoration

### Components
- UI components moved to `shared/components/ui` with atomic design structure
- Feature-specific components moved to their respective feature directories
- Layout components consolidated in `shared/components/layout`

### Services & Hooks
- Authentication logic moved to `features/authentication/services/authService.ts`
- Photo processing moved to `features/photo-restoration/services/photoService.ts`
- State management refactored into feature-specific hooks

## Testing Recommendations

- Test the authentication flow
- Test the payment process
- Test photo restoration functionality
- Verify responsive design works correctly
- Check compatibility across modern browsers
